# Terraform Automation Repository

This repository contains Terraform configurations for automating infrastructure provisioning.

## Overview

The Terraform scripts provided here help in provisioning and managing infrastructure resources on various cloud platforms.

## Prerequisites

## Directory Structure

- **`main.tf`**: This file contains the main Terraform configuration.
- **`variables.tf`**: Define variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- **`outputs.tf`**: Define outputs that are displayed after applying Terraform configurations.
- **`terraform.tfstate`**: This file keeps track of the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

## Notes
